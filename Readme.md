This currently doesn't do anything fun, nor does it utilize Dagger as of yet. I'm just getting this set up to try it out.

The idea is that I'll have two separage JSON providers, one local, and one remote. I'd like to use Dagger to easily switch between the two. Again, Dagger is not implemented here yet. I'll be updating when it is.
